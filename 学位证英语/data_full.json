What kind of people are welcomed by others, then?\n\nThere are people that naturally attract you. By being with them just once, you start to like them. If you wonder why they attract people and want to be a person like them, you should learn how to develop the traits that they have.\n\nFirstly, everybody wants to be happy, and nobody wants to spend their time with a sad person. Well, you see, there is what you call mood linkage. If you are with a jolly(愉快的)person, you are more probably to be happy. When people choose to spend time with a person, they are more likely to choose those who are cheerful. So if you are a happy person, many people will want to spend their time with you.\n\nNext, everybody needs someone to give encouragement to them, because sometimes in our lives we experience failure, sadness, problems and other bad things. So if you always choose to cheer others up with encouraging words or actions, they will be willing to spend time with you.\n\nLastly, you are not a friend if you don't lend a hand to your friends when they need help. You should always be helpful to them, no matter what it costs, because when you need help, they will be there for you, too.\n\nIt feels good if people want to be your friends because of your character. So if you want to attract friends, I suggest you learn to develop these traits."

She got out to open a metal gate that blocked her path. That's when she heard the whistle sounded by the driver of a train. Her Renault Clio was parked across a railway line. Seconds later, she watched the train drag her car almost a kilometre down the railway tracks.\n\nCeely's near miss made the news because she blamed it on he GPS (导航仪). She had never driven the route before. It was dark and raining heavily. Ceely was relying on her GPS, but it made no mention of the crossing. \"I put my complete trust in the device and it led me right into the path of a speeding train,\" she told the BBC.\n\nWho is to blame here? Rick Stevenson, who tells Ceely's story in his book When Machines Fail Us, points the finger at the limitations of technology. We put our faith in digital devices, he says, but our digital helpers are too often not up to the job. They are filled with small problems. And it's not just GPS devices: Stevenson takes us on a tour of digital disasters involving everything from mobile phones to wireless keyboards.\n\nThe problem with his argument in the book is that it's not clear why he only focuses on digital technology, while there may be a number of other possible causes. A map-maker might have left the crossing off a paper map. Maybe we should blame Ceely for not paying attention. Perhaps the railway authorities are at fault for poor singalling system. Or maybe someone has studied the relative dangers and worked out that there really is something specific wrong with the GPS equipment. But Stevenson doesn't say.\n\nIt's a problem that runs through the book. In a section on cars, Stevenson gives an account of the advanced techniques that criminals use to defeat computer-based locking systems for cars. He offers two independent sets of figures on car theft; both show a small rise in some parts of the country. He says that once again not all new locks have proved reliable. Perhaps, but maybe it's also due to the shortage of policemen on the streets. Or changing social circumstances. Or some combination of these factors.\n\nThe game between humans and their smart devices is amusing and complex. It is shaped by economics and psychology and the cultures we live in. Somewhere in the mix of those forces there may be a way for a wiser use of technology. If there is such a way, it should involve more than just an awareness of the shortcomings of our machines. After all, we have lived with them for thousands of years. They have probably been fooling us for just as long."

He stressed that workmanship and quality were more important than quantity for industrial production. It would be necessary to produce quality goods for the international market to compete with those produced in other countries. The French economy needed a larger share of the international market to balance its import and export trade.\n\nFrench industrial and agricultural production was still inadequate to meet the immediate needs of the people, let alone long-ranged developments. Essential imports had stretched the national credit to the breaking point. Rents were tightly controlled, but the extreme inflation affected general population most severely through the cost of food. Food costs took workers as much as 80 per cent of their income. Wages, it is true, had risen. Extensive family allowances(津贴) and benefits were paid by the state, and there was full time and overtime employment. Taken together, these factors enabled the working class to exist but allowed them no sense of security.

My best friend, Li Ming, waved me over. \"You look 62! Here,\" he said, tossing me a towel. \"Dry your hair before Ms. Wang arrives.\"\n\nMs. Wang, our English teacher, is strict but 63. Today, she announced a surprise quiz. My heart sank-I'd forgotten to study! As the papers were 64, I glanced at Li Ming's answers. Copying them felt wrong, but fear of failure 65 me.\n\nAfter class, Ms. Wang called me to her desk. \"I noticed you struggling,\" she said gently. \"Cheating never solves problems. Next time, come to me for help.\" Her words stung, but I knew she was right.\n\nThat afternoon, I stayed late to study. The rain had stopped, and sunlight streamed through the windows. Li Ming joined me, 66 a cup of hot chocolate. \"Told you Ms. Wang isn't so bad,\" he grinned. \"She just wants us to 67.\"\n\nWe studied until the library closed. Walking home, I felt lighter. The quiz score didn't matter anymore; I'd learned a bigger lesson about 68. The next day, Ms. Wang returned our quizzes. To my surprise, I'd passed! \"Good effort,\" she wrote in red ink. I glanced at Li Ming, who winked. \"See? Honesty 69.\"\n\nAs weeks passed, I visited Ms. Wang for extra help. Slowly, my grades improved. One afternoon, she handed me a book. \"For your 70,\" she said. \"You've come a long way.\""

The robot courier can travel up to 4 miles per hour for about 10 miles. It uses a GPS signal and nine cameras to navigate (确定方向). Instead of a person arriving at their door, customers could find themselves receiving a notification on their phone that says a robot is on its way and a code to unlock the automated courier. \"Put the code in, the robot opens up, and there's your food,\" said David Buttress, chief manager of Just Eat.\n\nThe robot, which has so far been tested in Greenwich, Milton Keynes and Glastonbury, costs 1 to transport within 3 miles, compared with the £3 to £6 it costs for a human courier. To date 30 robots have driven nearly 5,000 miles without getting into an accident or finding themselves picked on by passers-by. They have driven in more than 40 cities around the world, including London and Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nAn initial worry was how the public would react to robots. But Martinson said the public has been calm when passing the delivery machine on the streets. \"The most surprising reaction has been the lack of reaction,\" said Martinson. Another significant fear was that people would disrupt (扰乱) the robots, or try to steal them and their contents. To prevent this, the robot is fitted with nine cameras, two way audio, and movement sensors that send a warning if it is lifted off the ground. And it opens only with a pass code provided to the customer via a notification. \"It's much easier to shoplift than it is to steal a robot,\" said Martinson."
